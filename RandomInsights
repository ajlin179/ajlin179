1. convolutional neural network -> 
convolutional means ?
Math thinking perpective:
Convolutional neural networks get their name from a mathematical operation called convolution. This is a specialized kind of linear operation, and CNNs use this mathematical operation instead of matrix multiplication in at least one of the layers.

Poet perpective:
convolutional -> "Kan" + "olli" + "Nal"  ---> In Tamil, Kan means Eye , Olli means Light :) This is how eye processing the image.
